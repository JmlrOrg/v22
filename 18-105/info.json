    "abstract": "Suppose that we wish to estimate a vector $\\mathbf{x}$ from a set of binary paired comparisons of the form \"$\\mathbf{x}$ is closer to $\\mathbf{p}$ than to $\\mathbf{q}$\" for various choices of vectors $\\mathbf{p}$ and $\\mathbf{q}$. The problem of estimating $\\mathbf{x}$ from this type of observation arises in a variety of contexts, including nonmetric multidimensional scaling, \"unfolding,\" and ranking problems, often because it provides a powerful and flexible model of preference. We describe theoretical bounds for how well we can expect to estimate $\\mathbf{x}$ under a randomized model for $\\mathbf{p}$ and $\\mathbf{q}$. We also present results for the case where the comparisons are noisy and subject to some degree of error. Additionally, we show that under a randomized model for $\\mathbf{p}$ and $\\mathbf{q}$, a suitable number of binary paired comparisons yield a stable embedding of the space of target vectors. Finally, we also show that we can achieve significant gains by adaptively changing the distribution for choosing $\\mathbf{p}$ and $\\mathbf{q}$.",
