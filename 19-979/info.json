    "abstract": "We derive bounds on the path length $\\zeta$ of gradient descent (GD) and gradient flow (GF) curves for various classes of smooth convex and nonconvex functions. Among other results, we prove that: (a) if the iterates are linearly convergent with factor $(1-c)$, then $\\zeta$ is at most $\\mathcal{O}(1/c)$; (b) under the Polyak-Kurdyka-\\L ojasiewicz (PKL) condition, $\\zeta$ is at most $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\kappa})$, where $\\kappa$ is the condition number, and at least $\\widetilde\\Omega(\\sqrt{d} \\wedge \\kappa^{1/4})$; (c) for quadratics, $\\zeta$ is $\\Theta(\\min\\{\\sqrt{d},\\sqrt{\\log \\kappa}\\})$ and in some cases can be independent of $\\kappa$; (d) assuming just convexity, $\\zeta$ can be at most $2^{4d\\log d}$; (e) for separable quasiconvex functions, $\\zeta$ is ${\\Theta}(\\sqrt{d})$. Thus, we advance current understanding of the properties of GD and GF curves beyond rates of convergence. We expect our techniques to facilitate future studies for other algorithms.",
