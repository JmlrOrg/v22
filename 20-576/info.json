    "abstract": "We propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm based on third-order Langevin dynamics for sampling from distributions with smooth, log-concave densities.  The higher-order dynamics allow for more flexible discretization schemes, and we develop a specific method that combines splitting with more accurate integration.  For a broad class of $d$-dimensional distributions arising from generalized linear models, we prove that the resulting third-order algorithm produces samples from a distribution that is at most $\\varepsilon > 0$ in Wasserstein distance from the target distribution in $O\\left(\\frac{d^{1/4}}{ \\varepsilon^{1/2}} \\right)$ steps. This result requires only Lipschitz conditions on the gradient.  For general strongly convex potentials with $\\alpha$-th order smoothness, we prove that the mixing time scales as $O \\left( \\frac{d^{1/4}}{\\varepsilon^{1/2}} + \\frac{d^{1/2}}{ \\varepsilon^{1/(\\alpha - 1)}} \\right)$.",
